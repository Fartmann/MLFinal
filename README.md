## FINAL PROJECT FOR MACHINE LEARNING
## MADE BY ADAM SATYSHEV IT-2302

# GOALS
Develop and deploy a machine learning model to solve a binary classification problem.

# TOOLS
[https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/heart-disease/processed.cleveland.data] for **dataset**

**Random Forest** as classifier for a model

**VSCode** to run the code

**Flask** for Web service

**joblib** for suitable format for deployment

# RUNNING THE PROJECT
*Before running the project we have to download all of the libraries needed : `pip install flask numpy scikit-learn joblib pandas`

*Then we have to run binary.py to create and save model in .pkl files

*Then run app.py to open link in localhost in port of 5000

*Type all of the elements and see the prediction
